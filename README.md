Trading is a wide subject.
There are many factors that contribute to a trader's success.
A couple of factors that I'm interested in exploring is the comparing various types of trading. MACD, SMA-ema, Gaussian, and maybe ML. 

 "However, trading on that signal alone is hazardous. You should always take into account factors that have nothing to do with the fundamental financial well-being of the company, such as market trends, speculative selling, or macroeconomic news that might be coming into play."-Tom Streissguth
